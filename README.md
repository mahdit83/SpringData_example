# SpringData_example
In this project I am going to implement "Spring-Boot Data" features Adapted from https://www.safaribooksonline.com .
It is Originally for Spring but I convert and adapt it for using in Spring boot. I think this will be useful for who want to learn Spring-boot-data with good examples step by step.

I put lessons and chapters in branches. so you can start from chapter1_create_and_modify_data
